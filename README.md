finna-proxy
===========

Overview
--------

This is a proxy application for fetching metadata from
[finna.fi open API](https://www.kiwi.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=53839221)
and representing it by SRU protocol to enable cataloguing with Koha.

The app relies on fullRecord field of the API containing the original
catalogued record. As of now, there is no check whatsoever regarding
the data type returned. However, most returned records are either
MARC21 or FINMARC, so it works most of the time.

Requirements
------------

### server

* php 5.5
* Apache (or any webserver, given that you look at .htaccess and configure accordingly)
* DOMdocument

### client

* YAZ 5.x

At least some versions of YAZ 4 does not seem to work with the proxy,
nor does it work with "real" SRU implementations, such as the Library
of Congress open database. However, this is the version included with
Ubuntu Koha packages. To circumvent this problem, this is what I did:

1. install a 5.x version of YAZ and latest yazpp as Ubuntu packages
   from [Index Data](http://www.indexdata.com/software)
2. get package source for *libnet-z3950-zoom-perl*
3. rebuild and install it

Installation
------------

Clone it onto a directory, set up an Apache virtual host for it,
AllowOverride all. Create directory "logs" with Apache write
access. That should be it.

Bugs
----

Numerous. There is basically no error handling, the SRU specification
is not fully implemented etc. Also, finna.fi API seems to always
return XML with MARC21 namespace, even though the actual data format
may be FINMARC. Besides, the API might return Qualified Dublin Core as
well, but I haven't found a query that would return such a result so
that I could write code that'd just drop it from results, as Koha
doesn't support it anyway.
